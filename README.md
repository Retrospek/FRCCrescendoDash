This program is hosted on the Streamlit Cloud. If the cloud says "waking up" that just mean that the server has a timed out session. Instead just take the code, copy it, and run it through the terminal. You would do this by grabbing the relative path of Home.py and then running "streamlit run (relative path)" - exclude the parenthesis.
