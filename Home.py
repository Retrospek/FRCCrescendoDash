st.write("""I wanted to create a scouting prediction app that would take the likelyhood of
          any given 3 teams beating any other 3 teams. To accomplish this, I researched how to 
          compare two comparable averages and standard deviations. Additionally, I had experience in neural networks and because this was 
          a predictive task, I thought that perhaps some level of ML or even deep learning could be used. However, I ran into the issue of a lack of data, and I quickly
          realized that in order for me to create a predictive model that took at least 4 attributes that it would need approximately 40 data inputs, according to the 10x rule
          . With this knowledge, I instead went towards a more statistics based approach. The method of using a normal cumumalitive distribution function required normalized data
          . Knowing this I delved into past matches, and proved that as a team progresses throughout a tournament it will have a normally distributed graph of data points that represent points scored.
          Knowing this I generated a cumulative average and standard deviation for each of the alliances and applied the norm.cdf function to calculate the possibility of the Blue team winning. """)
